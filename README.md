This is a repository for my work in CS 255 System Analysis and Design. 
Included is my work from project 2.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

Driver Pass was a company that intended to start a driver training program that enabled their customers to use online tools and online scheduling as well as in person training and scheduling. I was able to understand how to organize sequence details well. Using the transcript with limited information and minute details and transform it into a system that the client could use.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In the final project the option to not include methods was offered, but not including the methods actuall caused me more confusion in determining the relationships bewtween the different entities in the system. It is important to consider the user's needs because they are the ones using the system if it is a headache to use that feedback gets to the upper chains and can result in the loss of a client in future software needs or updates.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Taking the project in large categories and systematically breaking those categories into smaller parts was my main strategy in order to prevent the loss of any information from the customer and ensure that the client will be satisfied on all levels.
